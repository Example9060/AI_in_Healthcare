Cedars-Sinai, a nonprofit healthcare organization in Los Angeles, launched an artificial intelligence-powered virtual platform called Cedars-Sinai Connect (CS Connect) to expand patients' access to primary care and reduce administrative burdens on physicians. CS Connect aims to improve the speed of care delivery and offer patients convenient healthcare support 24/7. The platform was built using K Health and syncs patients' electronic health records for AI-powered treatment recommendations.

Patients can access CS Connect via a mobile app or website, where a chatbot asks about symptoms, compares them to existing medical records, and asks detailed questions. The AI then summarizes the patient's information and recommends a treatment. Physicians can review, validate, and sign off on each patient's treatment plan. A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in April 2025 found that AI recommendations in CS Connect were often rated as higher quality than physicians' decisions when they differed. The platform had approximately 42,000 individual users as of the study's publication. The AI's ability to identify patterns and make optimal treatment recommendations showcases the potential of AI in improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness.

The global radiology workforce is facing a significant shortage, with demand for imaging services expected to outpace supply by 1.2% annually by 2025. This crisis is driven by aging populations, rising chronic disease prevalence, and post-pandemic healthcare demand surges. Operational inefficiencies and unmet patient needs are compounded by high burnout rates among radiologists and staffing shortages in rural hospitals. GE HealthCare is addressing these challenges with AI-driven X-ray innovations that automate workflows, reduce errors, and enhance diagnostic accuracy. The company's Definium Pace Select ET and AMX Navigate systems integrate AI to automate 60% of technologist tasks and enable 24/7 AI triage, reducing burnout and expanding access. GE HealthCare's collaboration with NVIDIA to develop autonomous X-ray and ultrasound systems could handle 50% of routine exams, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, freeing professionals to focus on complex cases. These AI-driven strategies align with the growth of the global medical AI market and the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare.
